Libraries are losing relevance and aren’t receiving the funding they need. State and Federal funding only account for less than 5% of the total funding, providing only around $30k per year to each library in California, which isn’t even enough to cover one librarian's salary. Our project seeks to increase awareness and participation in library events, fostering a community that is motivated to continue reading and improving literacy, especially as newer generations are falling behind due to a deeper reliance on technology and the lingering consequences of the pandemic, which have caused students to be left behind.

By creating this site, we aim to encourage more people to register for library cards and promoting community engagement through our book reviews and comments. Perhaps our greatest contribution would be our implementation of a leaderboard to encourage more engagement and competition within the community. We hope that through our project, more and more people are encouraged to read and improve their own literacy, which has been affected by the challenges of the last couple of years, and to participate in library events. This way, libraries can demonstrate that they still serve a large and dedicated community, warranting higher funding. This increased funding would lead to even better events, more materials and services, and greater benefits to the hardworking librarians.
